Simple Google Chrome extension that that serves some fun facts and an image at random. The starting use case is to serve up particularly special space missions.

This is now in a state where I'm not embarrassed about the layout's aesthetics. Next steps are (in no particular order): 

- [ ] Write up how to install this extension from GitHub
- [ ] Figure out how to upload to the Google Chrome extension store so regular users can use it
- [ ] Add more space missions for more fun! There are currently only 6 missions loaded
- [ ] Document the process to add content and the push it to the extension
- [ ] Make an options page
- [ ] Use the collapsible box as a container for more interesting content than a link (pictures, videos, text, etc)
- [ ] Make the add content process easier to add and delete content. This way individual users can add their own content themes, so it doesn't have to be space missions.
